## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

Consider an n-bit number that we increment based on the clock signal. If we reach its maximum value and try to increase it, the value will be reset. We call this state an **overflow**. The overflow time depends on the frequency of the clock signal, the number of bits, and on the prescaler value:

2. Shields are boards that can be attached to an Arduino board, significantly expand its capabilities, and makes prototyping much faster. See schematic of Multi-function shield and find out the connection of four LEDs (D1, D2, D3, D4) and three push buttons (S1-A1, S2-A2, S3-A3).

## Part 2: Timers

A timer (or counter) is a hardware block within an MCU and can be used to measure time events. ATmega328P has three timers, called:
   * Timer/Counter0,
   * Timer/Counter1, and
   * Timer/Counter2.

T/C0 and T/C2 are 8-bit timers, where T/C1 is a 16-bit timer. The counter counts in synchronization with microcontroller clock from 0 up to 255 (for 8-bit counter) or 65,535 (for 16-bit). Different clock sources can be selected for each timer using a CPU frequency divider with fixed prescaler values, such as 8, 64, 256, 1024, and others.

The timer modules can be configured with several special purpose registers. According to the [ATmega328P datasheet](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega328p) (eg in the **8-bit Timer/Counter0 with PWM > Register Description** section), which I/O registers and which bits configure the timer operations?

| Timer/Counter0 | Prescaler<br><br>8-bit data value<br>Overflow interrupt enable | TCCR0B<br><br>TCNT0<br>TIMSK0 | CS02 CS01 CS00<br>(000: stopped, 001: 1, 010: 8, 011: 64, 100: 256, 101: 1024)<br>TCNT0[7:0]<br>TOIE0 (timer enable; 1: enable, 0: disable) |

## Part 3: Polling and Interrupts

The state of continuous monitoring of any parameter is called **polling**. The microcontroller keeps checking the status of other devices; and while doing so, it does no other operation and consumes all its processing time for monitoring [[3]](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/support/technical-resources/engineer-school/mcu-programming-peripherals-04-interrupts.html).

While polling is a simple way to check for state changes, there's a cost. If the checking interval is too long, there can be a long lag between occurrence and detection and you may miss the change completely, if the state changes back before you check. A shorter interval will get faster and more reliable detection, but also consumes much more processing time and power, since many more checks will come back negative.

An alternative approach is to utilize **interrupts**. With this method, the state change generates an interrupt signal that causes the CPU to suspend its current operation (and save its current state), then execute the processing associated with the interrupt, and then restore its previous state and resume where it left off.

An interrupt is one of the fundamental features in a microcontroller. It is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention. Whenever an interrupt occurs, the controller completes the execution of the current instruction and starts the execution of an **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)** or Interrupt Handler. ISR tells the processor or controller what to do when the interrupt occurs [[4]](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/embedded_systems/es_interrupts.htm). After the interrupt code is executed, the program continues exactly where it left off.

Interrupts can be established for events such as a counter's value, a pin changing state, serial communication receiving of information, or the Analog to Digital Converted has finished the conversion process.

See the [ATmega328P datasheet](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega328p) (section **Interrupts > Interrupt Vectors in ATmega328 and ATmega328P**) for sources of interruptions that can occur on ATmega328P. Complete the selected interrupt sources in the following table. The names of the interrupt vectors in C can be found in [C library manual](https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/group__avr__interrupts.html).

### Timer library

1. In your words, describe the difference between common C function and interrupt service routine.
   * Function
   * Interrupt service routine

2. Part of the header file listing with syntax highlighting, which defines settings for Timer/Counter0:

```c
/**
 * @name  Definitions of Timer/Counter0
 * @note  F_CPU = 16 MHz
 */
// WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
```

3. Flowchart figure for function `main()` and interrupt service routine `ISR(TIMER1_OVF_vect)` of application that ensures the flashing of one LED in the timer interruption. When the button is pressed, the blinking is faster, when the button is released, it is slower. Use only a timer overflow and not a delay library.
